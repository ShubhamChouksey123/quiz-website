- [ ] Application accessible via public IP
- [ ] Home page loads correctly
- [ ] Database connectivity confirmed
- [ ] Quiz functionality working
- [ ] Email functionality operational
- [ ] Performance within acceptable limits

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 🌐 Functional Testing

## Troubleshooting Checklist

### 🔧 Common Issues Resolution
- [ ] If authentication fails: Regenerate API keys and auth tokens
- [ ] If SSH connection times out: Wait for cloud-init completion (check `/opt/quiz-app/.cloud-init-complete`)
- [ ] If network issues: Check security lists and route tables
- [ ] If container issues: Check resource limits and environment variables
- [ ] If database issues: Verify PostgreSQL container health
- [ ] If performance issues: Check resource allocation and usage
