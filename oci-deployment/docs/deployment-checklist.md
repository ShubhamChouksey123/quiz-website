## Cleanup and Rollback Procedures

### 🧹 Clean Instance State After Incomplete Deployment
If deployment fails or needs to be restarted from clean state:

```bash
# SSH into instance
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa opc@161.118.188.237

# Stop and remove all containers
cd /opt/quiz-app
docker compose down

# Remove application files
rm -f /opt/quiz-app/.env /opt/quiz-app/docker-compose.yml
rm -rf /opt/quiz-app/source

# Clean Docker images and cache
docker rmi quiz-app:local 2>/dev/null || true
docker system prune -af

# Clean data directory if needed (⚠️ DESTROYS DATABASE DATA)
sudo rm -rf /opt/quiz-app/data/postgres/*
```

### 🔄 Complete Rollback Plan
- [ ] Stop all containers: `docker compose down`
- [ ] Clean Docker images: `docker system prune -af`
- [ ] Remove application files: `rm -rf /opt/quiz-app/source /opt/quiz-app/.env /opt/quiz-app/docker-compose.yml`
- [ ] Clean OCIR images if necessary
- [ ] Review logs for failure analysis: `docker compose logs`
- [ ] Fix issues and restart deployment process
- [ ] Terminate compute instance only if infrastructure changes needed
