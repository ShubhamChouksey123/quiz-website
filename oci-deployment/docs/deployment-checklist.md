# OCI Deployment Checklist

## Current Status Summary

**✅ Prerequisites Phase: COMPLETE**
- All required tools installed and verified
- OCI access and permissions confirmed
- Environment variables configured
- SSH keys generated
- Free tier resources available (3/6 instances, 2 block volumes)

**✅ Issues Resolved:**
- Subnet public IP assignment issue resolved by switching to Load Balancer subnet

**🎯 Ready for Next Phase:**
- Infrastructure creation (`./02-create-infrastructure.sh`)
- Remote build and deployment approach validated

**📝 Deployment Strategy:**
Remote Build Approach - Docker image built on OCI instance (no local Docker required)

## Prerequisites Verification

### ✅ Phase 1: Environment Setup
- [x] `.env` file configured with OCI credentials - ✅ All required variables set
- [x] All sensitive information secured (not in documentation) - ✅ Documentation sanitized
- [x] Project repository cloned and accessible - ✅ Ready

### ✅ Phase 2: Tools Installation
- [x] OCI CLI installed (`brew install oci-cli` on macOS) - ✅ Version 3.66.1
- [x] OCI CLI configured (`~/.oci/config` and API key files) - ✅ Configured
- [x] Git installed - ✅ Version 2.51.0
- [x] curl installed - ✅ Version 8.7.1
- [x] jq installed (recommended) - ✅ Version 1.8.1
- [x] SSH key pair generated (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`) - ✅ Generated
- [ ] **Note**: Docker NOT required locally - will be installed on OCI instance

### ✅ Phase 3: OCI Access Verification
- [x] OCI authentication working (`oci iam region list`) - ✅ Authentication successful
- [x] Compartment access verified - ✅ Access confirmed
- [x] VCN and subnet accessible - ✅ VCN verified
- [x] Compute service permissions confirmed - ✅ Free tier shapes available
- [x] OCIR authentication successful - ✅ Repository access verified (1 repository found)
- [x] Free tier limits checked - ✅ Currently 3 instances, 2 volumes (within limits)
- [x] Subnet public IP issue resolved - ✅ Using Load Balancer subnet (10.0.20.0/24)

### ✅ Phase 4: Prerequisites Script
- [x] Run `./01-verify-prerequisites.sh` successfully - ✅ Completed (initial)
- [ ] Re-run `./01-verify-prerequisites.sh` with updated subnet - ⏳ NEXT STEP
- [x] All verification checks pass - ✅ All systems verified
- [x] `verification-status.log` created - ✅ Status saved

## Deployment Execution

### 🖥️ Phase 5: Infrastructure Creation
- [ ] Run `./02-create-infrastructure.sh`
- [ ] Compute instance created successfully
- [ ] Instance assigned public IP (address subnet limitation)
- [ ] SSH access to instance working
- [ ] Cloud-init completed successfully
- [ ] Docker and required software installed via cloud-init
- [ ] Application directories created

### 🚀 Phase 6: Application Build and Deployment
- [ ] Run `./03-deploy-application.sh`
- [ ] Source code copied to instance
- [ ] Docker image built on OCI instance
- [ ] Image pushed to OCIR successfully
- [ ] Configuration files deployed
- [ ] Docker Compose stack started
- [ ] PostgreSQL container running and healthy
- [ ] Application container running and healthy
- [ ] Database schema created automatically via Hibernate
- [ ] Container networking configured

### ✅ Phase 7: Deployment Validation
- [ ] Run `./04-validate-deployment.sh`
- [ ] Application accessible via public IP
- [ ] Home page loads correctly
- [ ] Database connectivity confirmed
- [ ] Quiz functionality working
- [ ] Email functionality operational
- [ ] Performance within acceptable limits

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 🌐 Functional Testing
- [ ] Access application: `http://<public-ip>:8080`
- [ ] Home page displays correctly
- [ ] Quiz creation and taking works
- [ ] User scoring system operational
- [ ] Leaderboard displays correctly
- [ ] Contact form submission works
- [ ] Email notifications sent successfully

### 🔍 Technical Validation
- [ ] Container health checks passing
- [ ] Database persistence verified
- [ ] Logs show no critical errors
- [ ] Resource usage within free tier limits
- [ ] Network connectivity stable
- [ ] Security configurations applied

### 📊 Performance Checks
- [ ] Page load times < 3 seconds
- [ ] Database queries < 1 second
- [ ] Memory usage < 80% of allocated
- [ ] CPU usage < 70% under normal load
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] Container restarts working properly

## Troubleshooting Checklist

### 🔧 Common Issues Resolution
- [ ] If authentication fails: Regenerate API keys and auth tokens
- [ ] If network issues: Check security lists and route tables
- [ ] If container issues: Check resource limits and environment variables
- [ ] If database issues: Verify PostgreSQL container health
- [ ] If performance issues: Check resource allocation and usage

### 📝 Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with any new deployment insights
- [ ] Document any custom configurations
- [ ] Record instance details for future reference
- [ ] Update .env with any new variables if needed

## Rollback Plan

### 🔄 If Deployment Fails
- [ ] Stop all containers: `docker-compose down`
- [ ] Terminate compute instance if needed
- [ ] Clean up OCIR images if necessary
- [ ] Review logs for failure analysis
- [ ] Fix issues and restart deployment process

## Success Criteria

### ✅ Deployment Complete When:
- [ ] All scripts execute without errors
- [ ] Application accessible via public internet
- [ ] All functionality tested and working
- [ ] Resource usage within free tier limits
