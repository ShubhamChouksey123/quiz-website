- [ ] Configuration files copied to instance
- [ ] Docker Compose stack started
- [ ] PostgreSQL container running and healthy
- [ ] Application container running and healthy
- [ ] Database schema created automatically
- [ ] Container networking configured

### ‚úÖ Phase 8: Deployment Validation

- [ ] Application accessible via public IP
- [ ] Home page loads correctly
- [ ] Database connectivity confirmed
- [ ] Quiz functionality working
- [ ] Email functionality operational
- [ ] Performance within acceptable limits

## Post-Deployment Verification

### üåê Functional Testing

- [ ] Database persistence verified
- [ ] Logs show no critical errors
- [ ] Resource usage within free tier limits
- [ ] Network connectivity stable
- [ ] Security configurations applied

### üìä Performance Checks
- [ ] Page load times < 3 seconds
- [ ] Database queries < 1 second
- [ ] Memory usage < 80% of allocated
- [ ] CPU usage < 70% under normal load
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] Container restarts working properly

## Troubleshooting Checklist

### üîß Common Issues Resolution
- [ ] If authentication fails: Regenerate API keys and auth tokens
- [ ] If network issues: Check security lists and route tables
- [ ] If container issues: Check resource limits and environment variables
- [ ] If database issues: Verify PostgreSQL container health
- [ ] If performance issues: Check resource allocation and usage

### üìù Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with any new deployment insights
- [ ] Document any custom configurations
- [ ] Record instance details for future reference
- [ ] Update .env with any new variables if needed

## Rollback Plan

### üîÑ If Deployment Fails
- [ ] Stop all containers: `docker-compose down`
- [ ] Terminate compute instance if needed
- [ ] Clean up OCIR images if necessary
- [ ] Review logs for failure analysis
- [ ] Fix issues and restart deployment process

## Success Criteria
